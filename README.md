# Bluekid
Bluekid is a live online quiz platform made for students. Bluekid is inspired from [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) & [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/).

## About
Bluekid is made by FunFoxRR as a fun little project for me and my friends to play. Little did I know, this was going to be harder then I thought. I also started making this to learn about HTML more.

## Resources
I use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for my realtime data. It is free but if you go beond the free limits, you will have to pay. It is super cheep though!
