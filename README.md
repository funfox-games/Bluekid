## Bluekid Gamemode Ideas
- Art: You have an ink meter and to get more ink you need to anwser questions. Everyone edits the same canvas.
  - Art gamemode: the game will choose something and everyone will have to make that item on the same canvas. Judging is decided by game host or chosen person

## Developer
This is for me, funfox, to use when developing

### Things to add to the todo:
- Increase kit question char limit

- Make firebase and webhooks stuff in .env file because now public repos
