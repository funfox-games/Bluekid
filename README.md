# Bluekid
Bluekid is the ideal education-entertainment website! It allows hosted games like Blooket and Gimkit, you can buy characters with in-game currency, and make your own social profile!

I decided to make Bluekid public so you can see what is going on back here. **I do not recommend using my code as a guide, I am a messy coder.**
